# Parallelized Processing: Click Through Rate Prediction

This was done for MIDS W261 Final (Group Project)
Authors: Andy Carlson, Mark Gin, Michelle Liu, Kathleen Wang

In this project, we explored parallelized processing and demonstrated understanding of the basic concepts. We built parallelized tree from scratch, but used MLLib from Pyspark to predict the click through rate.
